This is my attempt at simulating Conway's Game of Life. The game will run until the specified generations have passed or until the board is empty, whichever happens first.

To run it:
```
$ bundle
```3
If no arguments are given for num_of_rows or num_of_cols, the board will default to a random number between 1 and 50. If no arguments are given for generations, it will default to 50.

Enjoy!
